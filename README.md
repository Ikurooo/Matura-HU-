## Description
Tiny little scripts/projects that i created back in the day to learn the fundimentals of programming.
These tiny projects are based on the Hungarian matura and the respective exercises are attached as pdfs.

## Order
The files are not in the order of which I've solved them in, but rather the year which the matura was released.
The ones that look more like scripts rather than well-structured code are the ones that have been solved first.

## License
Feel free to use, modify and distribute these scripts as you see fit.

## NOTE: Only files predating 2023 are ones which I've done as a complete beginner!
